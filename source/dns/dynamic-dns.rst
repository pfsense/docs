Configuring Dynamic DNS
=======================

Dynamic DNS (DynDNS), found under **Services > Dynamic DNS**, will
update an external provider with the current public IP address on the
firewall. This keeps a constant DNS hostname, even if the IP address
changes periodically. Whenever an interface changes in some way, DHCP
lease renew, PPPoE logout/login, etc, the IP will be updated.

pfSense supports more than 15 different DynDNS providers. In addition to the
normal public services, pfSense also supports RFC 2136 DNS updates to DNS
servers.

In currently supported versions of pfSense, the DynDNS client supports
using multiple DynDNS and RFC 2136 clients. These can be used to update
multiple services on the same interface, or multiple interfaces.

There are two tabs under Dynamic DNS, one for DynDNS providers, and one
for RFC 2136 servers. Each tab has a list of currently configured
clients, which reflects not only their configuration but also their
status. Additional clients can be managed from these lists.

When editing a DynDNS client, first pick a DynDNS service provider, then
choose Interface with the IP address to update. Enter a hostname,
username, password, and description. Optionally, an MX record and
wildcard support may be enabled depending on the provider.

When editing an RFC 2136 client, first pick the interface with the IP to
update, enter a hostname, Time To Live (TTL) for the DNS record, Key
name (which must match the setting on the server), Key type of Host,
Zone, or User, an HMAC-MD5 key, the DNS server IP address, and a
description. TCP transactions may optionally be used instead of UDP.

two hostnames.

DNS Made Easy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`DNS Made Easy <http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/integration/dynamicdns/>`__
is a DNS hosting provider that also allows dynamic DNS services.

.. note:: Seems there might be an issue using complex passwords, testing
   shows that letters and numbers only works without problems

   1. Use a "simple" password (alphanumeric), using the 15-byte maximum (for DNS Made Easy) to make things as secure as possible,
   2. You do not need a "business" account on DNS Made Easy; any account at all works fine,
   3. Enter the DNS ID for both the hostname and the username in the pfSense software.

RFC 2136
--------

RFC 2136 is a way to securely update host or zone records in a name
server using a DNS query directly, rather than a web-based update system
that many others use.

RFC 2136 updates are also supported if access to a DNS server enabled
for RFC2136 is available. To configure a DNS server for RFC 2136 server,
see: :doc:`RFC2136 Dynamic DNS </dns/rfc2136-dynamic-dns>`.

RFC 2136 also supports IPv6 updates, which other web-based providers may
not yet support.
