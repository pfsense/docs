Load Balancing Uneven Multi-WAN Connections
===========================================

Navigate to **System > Routing**. Edit the gateway, and select a
**Weight** in the advanced options. The weight sets the ratio for use of
a gateway.

For example, if there are two gateways set with a weight of 3 and 1
respectively, then out of four connections, three will use the first
gateway, and one will use the second.
