What are HEAD, RELENG 2 1, RELENG 2 0, etc
==========================================

This is the terminology used to refer to a specific git branch of
pfSense source code.

HEAD (master)
-------------

HEAD, also known as -HEAD or "master", refers to the development version
of pfSense, where all new features are first added. When a release
nears, HEAD is branched to a RELENG (Release Engineering) branch. This
follows the FreeBSD project's development model.

RELENG_2_3
----------

This branch is under active development for the 2.3.1 release.

RELENG_2_3_0
------------

This branch is under active maintenance for 2.3 errata.
