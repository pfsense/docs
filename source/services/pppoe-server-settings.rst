PPPoE Server Settings
=====================

The **PPPoE server** (**Services > PPPoE Server**) allows pfSense to
terminal connections from PPPoE clients. This can be used as a means to
restrict network access on a given interface, either wired or wireless. The
setup is very similar to the PPTP Server.

As with PPTP, the authentication can be handled internally with users
added in the PPPoE settings or by passing authentication off to a RADIUS
server. Multiple PPPoE servers may be defined for separate interfaces.
