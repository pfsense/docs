Using Wake on LAN
=================

The `Wake on LAN`_ (WoL) service, at **Services > Wake on LAN**, can send a
"magic packet" to a workstation on a locally connected network which
will power on a workstation if it is configured properly.

To send a WoL magic packet, pick the **Interface**, enter a **MAC
address**, and click **Send**.

A list of WoL clients may also be managed for later use. All clients in the WoL
list may be awoken at once by clicking |fa-power-off| above the list.
