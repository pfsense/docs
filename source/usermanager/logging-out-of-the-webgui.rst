Logging Out of the WebGUI
=========================

In current versions of pfSense, log off by navigating to *System >
Logout* or by closing the browser window.

Sessions will automatically expire if they are idle for longer than the
**Session Timeout** defined on **System > User Manager**, **Settings**
tab. The default session timeout is 4 hours (240 minutes) of idle time.
