Short for Optional, used to describe interfaces other than LAN and WAN. These
can be Ethernet, wireless, or other types of interfaces. Additional networks can
be added using OPT interfaces. Common uses include multiple LAN segments, DMZ

OPT interfaces can function as additional WAN connections, referred to
as OPT WAN interfaces.
