2.2.3 New Features and Changes
==============================

Security/Errata Notices
-----------------------

-  `pfSense-SA-15\_06.webgui <https://www.pfsense.org/security/advisories/pfSense-SA-15_06.webgui.asc>`__:
   Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in the pfSense WebGUI

   -  The complete list of affected pages and fields is very large and
      all are listed in the linked SA.

-  `FreeBSD-SA-15:10.openssl <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15%3A10.openssl.asc>`__:
   Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities (Including Logjam): CVE-2015-1788,
   CVE-2015-1789, CVE-2015-1790, CVE-2015-1791, CVE-2015-1792,
   CVE-2015-4000

   -  NOTE: pfSense ships with a default set of DH parameters due to the
      time/CPU they require to generate. A new set of DH parameters may
      be generated by the user at any time as described in `Importing
      OpenVPN DH Parameters <Importing_OpenVPN_DH_Parameters>`__

-  Fixes for `filesystem
   corruption <Filesystem_Corruption_(503_errors,_cannot_get_uid)>`__ in
   various cases during an unclean shut down (crash, power loss, etc.).
   `#4523 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4523>`__

   -  Changed new filesystems to use the 'sync' option to avoid loss of
      data.
   -  Added upgrade code to activate the 'sync' option on the root slice
      for existing installations.
   -  Changed new filesystems to use softupdates and journaling (AKA
      SU+J).
   -  Changed the way fsck is handled at boot time:

      -  Followed best practice of using fsck from FreeBSD rc.d/fsck
         script. (Run preen mode first and later try forcefully fixing
         issues.)
      -  Added as much information during boot on the status of the
         filesystem as possible.
      -  Changed fsck to run with -C flag and always in foreground
         during boot to prevent issues that might schedule background
         mode.

-  The forcesync patch for
   `#2401 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/2401>`__ was considered
   harmful to the filesystem and removed. As such, there may be some
   noticeable slowness with NanoBSD on certain slower disks, especially
   CF cards and to a lesser extent, SD cards. If this is a problem, the
   filesystem may be kept read-write on a permanent basis using the
   option on **Diagnostics > NanoBSD**.

Rules/Aliases/NAT
-----------------

-  Fixed a problem with more than 64 IP addresses in the "self" table in
   pf.
-  Fixed issues with FQDNs in aliases causing static entries to be lost.
   `#4296 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4296>`__
-  Added the tracker ID rule number lookup to dynamic firewall log.
   `#4730 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4730>`__
-  Fixed alias rename and delete not being propagated to outbound NAT.
   `#4701 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4701>`__
-  Fixed tracker IDs of policy route negation rules which had been
   duplicating the tracker ID of the rule they were based upon. This
   confused the log parser and displayed the negation rule rather than
   the actual rule. `#4651 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4651>`__
-  Fixed logging of passed IGMP traffic when the rule is not set to log.
   `#4383 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4383>`__
-  Fixed a situation where a combination of L2TP, overlapping subnets,
   port forwards and NAT reflection could cause an invalid ruleset.
   `#4772 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4772>`__
-  Added a GUI field to control the size of the pf fragment limit
   `#4775 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4775>`__

   5.3.0, which is useful for IKEv2.
   `#4626 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4626>`__
-  Fixed vpn\_ipsec\_configure so it always performs a filter reload to
   ensure the ruleset is updated where necessary in every IPsec change
   scenario. `#4631 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4631>`__
-  Added support for EAP-RADIUS to IKEv2 Mobile Clients.
   `#4614 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4614>`__

   mobile IPsec on 32-bit installations (set
   net.inet.ipsec.directdispatch=0 on i386).
   `#4537 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4537>`__
-  Fixed an issue with FQDN hosts and PSKs.
   `#4785 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4785>`__

OpenVPN
-------

-  Added a space to the OpenVPN TLS Verify script to avoid appended
   parameters appearing the same as existing parameters.
-  Fixed get\_interface\_ip() to return the IP address correctly for
   gateway groups specifying a VIP, which fixed OpenVPN clients not
   working with gateway groups specifying VIPs.
   `#4661 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4661>`__
-  Changed the OpenVPN client settings to allow just one of either the

   disconnection of users especially when triggered via XMLRPC.
   `#4625 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4625>`__

Operating System
----------------

-  Fixed both the kernel and choparp to better handle I/O and prevent
   issues in the way it handles BPF, which can contribute to a panic
   when using Proxy ARP VIPs.
   `#4685 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4685>`__
-  Merged a patch that avoids a panic on sockbuf module.
   `#4689 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4689>`__
-  Fixed AESNI to be SMP friendly to avoid various decryption errors and
   possible encryption mistakes. Also present
   critical\_enter/critical\_exit to avoid preemption of the
   currentrunning thread which should fix panics.
   `#4702 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4702>`__

   altq changes for ixgbe to the large ixgbe patch.
-  Enabled ix/ixv/ixl modules in the kernel
-  Fixed duplication of statistics on vlan(4) interfaces for outgoing
   bytes `#3314 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3314>`__
-  Fixed updating wireless statistics so that the output bytes are not
   always zero. `#4028 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4028>`__
-  Added a patch from `FreeBSD PR
   200722 <https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=200722>`__

   interface to an existing name.
-  Fixed SLAAC/DHCPv6 handling for cases where the global SLAAC IPv6
   address might be present when using DHCPv6.
   `#4483 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4483>`__

   `#4397 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4397>`__

Packages
--------

   had changes pushed back into FreeBSD ports.
-  Fixed an issue where rebuild\_package\_binaries\_pbi.php could fail
   due to missing build files.
   `#4600 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4600>`__

DHCP/RA
-------

-  Clarified that DNS Forwarder and Resolver both apply in DHCP/DHCPv6
   and router advertisements.
   `#3730 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/3730>`__
-  Removed unnecessary filtering on the DHCP static mappings table.
-  Added appropriate RA Flags for "Stateless DHCP".
-  Added error checking to avoid warnings about DHCP relay during boot.
-  Fixed hostname validation for static DHCP leases such that only fully
   qualified hostnames must be unique, not only short names.
-  Fixed adding DHCP static mappings from the DHCP leases view to
   non-default pools.
   `#4649 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4649>`__
-  Stopped invalid DHCP settings from being applied when input errors
   exist.
-  Removed DHCP static lease overlap cleanup and its associated function

   with failover scenarios, especially when adding/editing/removing
   static mappings.

Web GUI
-------

-  Fixed language selection.
   `#4705 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4705>`__
-  Changes to status.php to make it easier to gather and submit support
   information:

   -  Added sanitization of OpenVPN static/tls keys to status.php.
   -  Cleaned up, organized, and expanded the info presented by
      status.php.
   -  Changed status.php to additionally save the output to individual
      text files and compress them into a .tgz for later download.

-  Fixed setup wizard LAN DHCP pool calculation to avoid an invalid
   pool.
-  Improved the setup wizard hostname check.
   `#4712 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4712>`__
-  Fixed some minor text issues in wizards.
-  Changed the wizard to use the current WAN gateway name rather than
   assuming the name.
   `#4713 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4713>`__
-  Updated and corrected the wireless status flags and capabilities
   list. There are many more possible flags, now documented at
   :doc:`Wireless Status </wireless/wireless-status>`.
-  Added a fall back to look up local user privileges and groups if the
   groups could not be found from LDAP and there is a local user.
-  Fixed Crash Reporter submissions when symlinks were present as part
   of crash report, which would fail to save the report on the server.
   `#4650 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4650>`__
-  Set a user agent for the Crash Reporter.
-  Cleaned up code logic in status\_upnp.php.

CARP
----

-  Changed CARP so that it does not trigger a carp demotion taskqueue if
   the value is 0, which can cause the cluster to misbehave.
-  Fixed issues for CARP+Bridges where pfSense would crash or freeze.
   `#4607 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4607>`__
-  Fixed the CARP plugin call for packages. The "interface" parameter
   was coming through as NULL during CARP events.
-  Added INIT event for CARP in devd.conf as an alternate for 'backup',
   otherwise scripts would not take down services during a MASTER->INIT
   transition. (e.g. interface unplug, link loss)
-  Fixed NTP so that it properly uses selected CARP IP addresses.
   `#4370 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4370>`__
-  Fixed CARP packet flow after initial interface creation.
   `#4633 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4633>`__

Traffic Shaper/Limiters
-----------------------

-  Fixed limiters when used with IPv6.
   `#2526 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/2526>`__
-  Corrected handling of NAT when RDR/BINAT is applied on packet and it
   is being sent to limiters.
   `#4596 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4596>`__

DNS
---

-  Consistently handle clear\_subsystem\_dirty after an Unbound restart.
-  Added a call to clear\_subsystem\_dirty('staticmaps') when using
   Unbound, otherwise DHCP static mappings would not fully apply when
   Unbound was in use.
   `#4678 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4678>`__
-  Fixed an Unbound warning when "dnsallowoverride" was off and port
   forwarding was on.
   `#4682 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4682>`__
-  Re-enabled verification for selfhost DynDNS since their chain issue
   has been resolved.
   `#4545 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4545>`__

Misc
----

-  Updated PHP to 5.5.26
-  Fixed various issues in the installer for GEOM mirrors (mirror slice
   detection, gmirror cleanup on non-clean disks.)
   `#4658 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4658>`__
-  Fixed new user creation to use skel as the source of new user files
   rather than copying from the home directory of *root*.
-  Changed growl so it will not be called if the configured address
   isn't an IP address or resolvable hostname. This avoids 1 minute
   timeout delay in fsockopen in growl.class. This change cuts that down
   to about a 20 second timeout.
   `#4739 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4739>`__
-  Added a reboot after restoring a full backup in the GUI.
   `#4107 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4107>`__
-  Deprecated */usr/local/bin/3gstat* as it was no longer used. It was
   replaced by *3gstats.php* long ago.
-  Started using the "host!" flag when setting CURLOPT\_INTERFACE, as
   recommended by the CURL documentation.
-  Started passing the interface to CURLOPT\_INTERFACE instead of the IP
   address, also started using the "if!" flag to avoid CURL trying to
   resolve the interface name.
-  Fixed NTP serial configuration to setup the serial port before
   attempting to configure a GPS unit.
-  Cleaned up various HTML/XHTML issues.
-  Fixed a check for deleting a VIP when in use by OpenVPN.
-  Fixed issues with backup/restore of a config.xml breaking the serial
   console on ADI installs.
   `#4720 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4720>`__
-  Fixed several issues with boot speed when WAN was disconnected.
   `#4442 <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/4442>`__

   -  Reduce the timeout for HTTP/HTTPS connection attempts for items
      like URL table aliases. Once connected, they can run past that. 5
      seconds should be more than enough for any properly-functioning
      network.

-  Removed some unused/obsolete files.
