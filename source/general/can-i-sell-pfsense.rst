Can I sell pfSense
==================

Many consulting companies offer pfSense solutions to their customers. A
business or individual can load pfSense for themselves, friends,
relatives, employers, and, yes, even customers, so long as the Trademark
Guidelines and `Apache 2.0 license>`_ requirements as detailed on the
website are obeyed by all parties involved.

What can not be offered is a commercial redistribution of pfSense®
software, for example the guidelines do not permit someone to offer
"Installation of pfSense® software" as a service or to sell a device
pre-loaded with pfSense® software to customers without the prior express
written permission of ESF pursuant to the trademark policy as referenced
in the `RCL Terms and Conditions`_.

Example 1: A consultant may offer firewall services (e.g. "Fred's
Firewalls"), without mentioning pfSense® software or using the logo in
their advertising, marketing material, and so on. They can install
pfSense® software and manage it for their customers.

Example 2: Fred's Firewalls may make a customized distribution pfSense®
software with their own name and logo used in place of the pfSense
marks. They can use the pfSense marks to truthfully describe the origin
of the software, such as "Fred's Firewall software is derived from the
pfSense CE source code." Even though Fred's Firewall is based on
pfSense® software, it can **not** be referred to as "pfSense® software"
since it has been modified.

Example 3: Fred's Firewalls may sell their customized firewall
distribution pre-loaded on systems to customers, so long as the
relationship to pfSense is clearly stated.

The Apache 2.0 license only applies to the software and **not** the
pfSense name and logo, which are trademarks and may not be used without
a license. Reading and understanding the `RCL Terms and Conditions`_
document is required before one considers selling pfSense Software.

Contributing Back to the Project
--------------------------------

We ask anyone profiting by using pfSense software to contribute to the
project in some fashion. Ideally with the level of contributions from a
business or individual corresponding to the amount of financial gain
received from use of pfSense software. Many paths exist for resellers
and consultants to contribute. For the long term success of the project
this support is critically important.

#. Purchase hardware and merchandise from the `Netgate store`_.
#. Become a `Netgate partner`_ to resell Netgate hardware pre-loaded with
   pfSense software.
#. Development contributions - Dedicate a portion of your internal
   developers' time to open source development.
#. Help with support and documentation - Assisting users on the forum
   and mailing list, or contributing documentation changes, aides the
   overall project.
#. Support subscription - we're glad to help resellers under our
   `support subscription`_.
   Having direct access to our team for any questions or deployment
   assistance helps ensure your success as a reseller.

Using the pfSense Name and Logo
-------------------------------

The "pfSense" name and logo are trademarks of Electric Sheep Fencing, LLC.

The pfSense software source code is open source and covered by the
`Apache 2.0 license`_. That license only covers the source code and **not** our
name and trademarks, which have restricted usage.

We think it is great that people want to promote and support the pfSense
project. At the same time, we also need to verify that what is referred
to as "pfSense" is a genuine instance of pfSense software and **not**
modified in any way.

-  The pfSense name and logo **MAY NOT** be used physically on a
   hardware device.

   -  For example: A sticker, badge, etching, or similar rendering of
      the pfSense name or logo is NOT allowed.

-  The pfSense logo **MAY NOT** be used on marketing materials or in
   other ways without a license, including references on websites.

-  The pfSense name **MAY** be used to describe the case that a product
   is based on a pfSense distribution, but the designated product name
   may *not* include pfSense or a derivative. Basically stating facts
   regarding product origin is acceptable. Anything that implies that
   your product is endorsed by or made by ESF or the pfSense project is
   *not* allowed.

   -  Some examples:

      -  "Blahsoft Fireblah based on pfSense software" -- Acceptable
      -  "Blahsoft pfSense Firewall" -- NOT Allowed

-  You may **ONLY** install an **UNMODIFIED** version of pfSense
   software and still call it "pfSense software".

   -  If the source code has been changed, compiled/rebuilt separately,
      included extra file installations such as themes or add-on
      scripts, or any other customizations, it can **not** be called
      "pfSense software", it must be called something else.
   -  Trademark protection aside, this requirement preserves the
      integrity and reputation of the pfSense project. It also prevents
      unverified changes that may be questionably implemented from being
      attributed to pfSense.

-  If a pfSense distribution is modified, the resulting software
   **CANNOT** be called "pfSense" or anything *similar*. The new name
   must be distinct from pfSense. Trademark law does not allow use of
   names or trademarks that are confusingly similar to the pfSense
   Marks. This means, among other things, that you may **not** use a
   variation of the pfSense Marks, their phonetic equivalents, mimicry,
   wordplay, or abbreviation with respect to similar or related
   projects, products, or services (for example, "pfSense Lifestyle,"
   "PFsense Community," "pf-Sense Sensibility," "pfSensor", etc.,
   **all** infringe on ESF's rights).

   -  Examples:

      -  "pfSomething", or "somethingSense" -- INFRINGING references
      -  "ExampleWall", "FireWidget" -- NON-Infringing references

-  The "pfSense" name **MAY NOT** be used in a company name or similar.
   You **CANNOT** call your company "pfSense Support, Ltd" or "pfSense
   Experts, LLC", or use it in a domain name or subdomain reference.
   However, you can state support for pfSense software, offer training
   for pfSense software, etc.

-  **You** **MUST** ensure there is a distinction between your company
   name and pfSense or Electric Sheep Fencing, LLC. It is **your**
   responsibility to be certain no relationship or endorsement is stated
   or implied between the two companies, unless we have explicitly
   licensed and agreed to such a statement.
