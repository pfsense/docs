Services Status and Control
===========================

**Status > Services** shows active services on the firewall, as well as
services from add-on packages.

There are many more services than are shown here, but only the ones
meant to be user-controlled are displayed. A service is also not
displayed if it is disabled.

To stop a service, press the stop button |fa-stop-circle|. To start a service,
press the start button |fa-play-circle|, to restart, press the restart button
|fa-repeat|.

More icons are displayed to visit other pages associated with a given
service's area. See :doc:`Shortcut Bar </config/shortcut-bar>` for details.
