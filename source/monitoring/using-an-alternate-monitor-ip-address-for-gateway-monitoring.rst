Using an Alternate Monitor IP Address for Gateway Monitoring
============================================================

In many scenarios, the quality graph for an interface may not be as
accurate as desired. The most common scenario is when a gateway, (i.e.
the next hop), is local to the site and not on the other end of an
Internet or remote connection.

To use an alternate address, do as follows:

-  Navigate to **System > Routing**
-  Click **'e**' to edit the gateway
-  Enter the IP address to ping for gateway monitoring in '''Alternative
   monitor IP '''
-  Click **Save**
-  Click **Apply Changes**
