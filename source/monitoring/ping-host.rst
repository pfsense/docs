Ping Host
=========

From **Diagnostics > Ping**, an ICMP echo request (aka ping) may be sent
to a given **Host**.

-  **Host**: A hostname or IP address to which the ping will be sent.
-  **IP Protocol**: The address type to ping when a hostname is entered
   that has both an A (*IPv4*) and AAAA (*IPv6*) record.
-  **Source Address**: The IP address from which the ping will be sent.
   This is especially important when testing LAN-to-LAN VPN
   connectivity.
-  **Count**: How many ping requests to send. A higher count will take
   longer to complete and display results (especially if the target is
   down).

Click **Ping** to start the process. The result will be displayed
automatically once complete. Do not nagivate away from the page while
the ping is running.
