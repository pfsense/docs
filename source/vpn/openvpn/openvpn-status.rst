OpenVPN Server and Client Status
================================

The OpenVPN status page (**Status > OpenVPN**) lists all client
connections to running OpenVPN server processes, and the status for all
OpenVPN clients.

Where possible, it will list the Common Name of the client, its Real
Address, Virtual Address, Connect time, and bytes sent/received.

The format and amount of information shown varies on the configuration
of the VPN instance.

For SSL/TLS servers, an additional choice is presented to view the
internal routing table from OpenVPN that lists which subnet(s) are
routed to which connected clients.
